/***
 * Introduction:
 *
 * Algorithms created with GEGL are expressed as graphs of nodes. The nodes
 * have associated image processing operations. A node has output and input
 * pads which can be connected. By connecting these nodes in chains a set of
 * image operation filters and combinators can be applied to the image data.
 *
 * To make GEGL process data you request a rectangular region of a node's
 * output pad to be rendered into a provided linear buffer of any (supported
 * by babl) pixel format. GEGL uses information provided by the nodes to
 * determine the smallest buffers needed at each stage of processing.
