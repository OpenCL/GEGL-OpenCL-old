v4lutils - utility library for Video4Linux

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
V4lutils is a utility library wraps Video4Linux API.
Currently, v4lutils is developled and released as a part of EffecTV, but you
can use and/or release this library separated from EffecTV.

SUMMARY OF USAGE
================
V4lutils employs OO-like model. All of status is stored in "v4ldevice" struct.
Please read comments in v4lutils.c for the details.
V4lutils is almost thread safe (I belive). v4lperror() may cause problem.
I'll try to fix this problem ASAP.
