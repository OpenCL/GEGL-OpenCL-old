Building from source
--------------------
GEGL and it's dependencies are known to work on Linux based systems, windows
with msys/mingw, and probably other platforms.

Download
~~~~~~~~
The latest development snapshot, and eventually stable versions of GEGL are
available at http://download.gimp.org/pub/gegl/[].

The current code under development can be
http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gegl/tree[browsed online] and cloned from
GNOME git using:

 $ git clone git://git.gnome.org/babl
 $ git clone git://git.gnome.org/gegl

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

GEGL currently builds and works on linux, win32 and OSX most probably also on
other systems where glib and gtk+ work.

  - Core
      * glib (including gobject, and gmodule) 2.32 or newer, which provides
        inheritance, dynamic modules, common algorithms and data structures
        for C programming.
      * json-glib 1.0.0 or newer, for loading operations from .json format
      * http://gegl.org/babl/[babl] 0.1.10 or newer (for pixel-format
        agnostisism).
      * libpng (png load/export ops, and image magick fallback import)
      * ruby (only if building from git)
  - Optional dependencies for operations.
      * SDL (display op)
      * libjpeg (jpg loader op)
      * libopenexr (exr loader op)
      * http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libopenraw[libopenraw] (raw
        loader op)
      * cairo, pango (text source op)
      * avcodec, avformat (ff-load and experimental ff-save)
      * librsvg (svg loader)
   - Documentation (this document)
      * asciidoc

Compiling
~~~~~~~~~
To build GEGL type the following in the toplevel source directory:

 $ ./configure  # or: ./autogen.sh if building from git
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
