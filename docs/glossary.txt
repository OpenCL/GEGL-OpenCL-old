GEGL Glossary
-------------

connection::
    A link/pipe routing image flow between operations within the graph goes
    from an output pad to an input pad, in graph glossary this might also be
    referred to as an edge.
DAG::
    Directed Acyclic Graph, see graph.
graph::
    A composition of nodes, the graph is a DAG.
node::
    The nodes are connected in the graph. A node has an associated operation or
    can be constructed graph.
operation::
    The processing primitive of GEGL, is where the actual image processing
    takes place. Operations are plug-ins and provide the actual functionality
    of GEGL
pad::
    The part of a node that exchanges image content. The place where image
    "pipes" are used to connect the various operations in the composition.
input pad::
  consumes image data, might also be seen as an image parameter to the
  operation.
output pad::
  a place where data can be requested, multiple input pads can reference
  the same output pad.
sampler::
    A resampling strategy used for transformations and warps.
property::
    Properties are what controls the behavior of operations. Through the use of
    GParamSpecs properties they are self documenting via introspection.
