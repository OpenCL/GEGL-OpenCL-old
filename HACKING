The git version of GEGL is known to work with the following autotools:

- GNU autoconf 2.54
- GNU automake 1.9.6
- GNU libtool 1.5

Newer versions of these tools will probably work.

To compile a git version of GEGL on your system, you will need to take
several steps to setup the tree for compilation.  You can do all these
steps at once by running:

gegl> ./autogen.sh
   
Basically this does the following for you (but see autogen.sh for
exactly what is happening):

gegl> aclocal 
gegl> automake 
gegl> autoconf 
gegl> configure

The autogen in GEGL also uses ruby to generate some of the plug-ins, and
the API reference.

Before running autogen.sh, make sure you have libtool in your path.  

Note that autogen.sh runs configure for you. If you wish to pass options 
to configure you can give those options to autogen.sh and they
will be passed on.
